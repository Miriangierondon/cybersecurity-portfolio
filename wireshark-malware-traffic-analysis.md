#  Malware Traffic Analysis Report

This report summarizes an investigation into suspicious network traffic using Wireshark. The goal was to identify signs of malicious behavior, such as command-and-control (C2) communications or misconfigured protocols.

## Key Findings

- **Suspicious IP Address**:  
  - `10.11.26.183` showed unusually high HTTP and SSDP traffic.

- **Unusual HTTP Request**:  
  - POST to `http://194.180.191.64/fakeurl.htm` with headers linked to **NetSupport Manager**, a common Remote Access Tool (RAT).

- **Malicious Indicators**:  
  - Use of unencrypted HTTP over an encrypted port.  
  - Encoded or obfuscated payload data.  
  - Lack of expected HTTP responses (e.g., no 200 OK).

- **C2 Communication Pattern**:  
  - Repeated requests to the same IP, suggesting beaconing or evasion tactics.

## Recommendations

- Block malicious IPs in firewall.
- Fix protocol misconfigurations.
- Monitor similar traffic patterns.
- Conduct deeper payload analysis.
- Train staff to report anomalies.
