#  Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio is a curated collection of cybersecurity projects that reflect my learning journey, hands-on experiences, and areas of interest within the field of information security.

Each project represents a step forward in developing real-world skills, from threat detection and network defense to ethical hacking and malware analysis. My goal with this portfolio is not only to demonstrate technical knowledge, but to show my ability to think critically, solve problems, and communicate findings clearly.

Whether you're an employer, collaborator, or fellow learnerâ€”thank you for taking the time to explore my work. I hope it gives you insight into my capabilities, growth, and passion for cybersecurity.
